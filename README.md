# Triple Bonus Crossword Checker

Every holiday I always seem to receive these mid-priced scratcher lottery tickets as generic present from last-minute gifters. It’s nice busywork having to cross-check and scratch off each letter, but darn does it get messy and also get me paranoid about binning a potential winning ticket.

With me about halfway through my coding bootcamp, I had a rough idea and enough confidence to write an app that could take the words and letters from the scratcher and return any matches. I’d say it was a nice project for me to keep practicing code through the holiday break and would challenge any one in my skill level to make use of their knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML to take a crack at writing their own version.

Good luck,

Gerard
